tcn.py: implements TCN classes using keras
Get_Data: Get data in real time and process accordingly
GRU.ipynb: GRU model
LSTM.ipynb: LSTM model
TCN.ipynb: TCN model
TCN-Attention: TCN model with attention mechanism added (the effect is too poor, did not participate in the comparison)
TCN-GRU: Combination model of TCN-GRU
TCN-LSTM: Combination model of TCN-LSTM
Compare.ipynb: perform model comparison drawing
Note: This code is to predict the 7-day case data in China. If you need to predict other days in other countries, simply modify the corresponding code
